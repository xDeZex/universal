# Claude Guidelines

DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE

## Communication
- No praise, I make mistakes, be direct and honest

## Flutter Standards
- Material 3 design, `const` constructors, camelCase/PascalCase naming
- Provider pattern for state, auto-save with SharedPreferences
- Wrap async in try-catch, use null-safe operators

## Code Quality
- Functions: 20-25 lines max, classes: 200-300 lines max
- No deep nesting (3-4 levels max), early returns preferred
- Extract repeated code, magic numbers, complex widgets
- Single responsibility, separate UI from business logic
- Clean imports: dart → packages → relative

## Testing (CRITICAL)
- **NEVER complete work if ANY tests fail**
- **ALWAYS run `flutter test` before claiming done**
- **Fix failing tests immediately or revert changes**
- Write tests before code (Red-Green-Refactor)

## File Structure
```
lib/models/     # Data only
lib/services/   # Business logic
lib/screens/    # UI pages
lib/widgets/    # Reusable UI
```

## Git & Environment
- Short commit messages, test before commit, `git add --all`
- No auto hot-reload, user triggers manually
- Run `flutter analyze` to fix warnings
